## [3.3.5] - 2025-10-08
- Chore: debug logging for mesh_lod use `console.log` instead of `console.debug`

## [3.3.4] - 2025-09-10
- Fix: import with missing `.js` extension

## [3.3.3] - 2025-09-08
- Update documentation and add an initial extension definition

## [3.3.2] - 2025-08-20
- Update KTX2 transcoder

## [3.3.1] - 2025-08-18
- Add: `waitForFirstCapture` option to LodsManager (e.g. `lodsManager.awaitLoading({waitForFirstCapture: true})`) to be able to not resolve the promise until at any promise has been capture (e.g. any LOD has started and finished loading). If necessary a signal can be provided to timeout.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-08-15
- Add LODsManager `overrideLodLevel` property. When set to a number >= 0 texture and mesh LODs will be loaded for that level

## [3.2.0] - 2025-08-11
- Change: `useNeedleProgressive` hook parameters. It now only requires the GLTFLoader and WebGLRenderer: `useNeedleProgressive(<loader>, <renderer>)` instead of `useNeedleProgressive(<url>, <renderer>, <loader>)`. This simplify usage when using the same GLTFLoader for multiple different model load operations.
- Internal: Start of web worker for texture and mesh LOD loading. Currently this can only be enabled by appending the `gltf-progressive-worker` query parameter to the URL.

## [3.1.1] - 2025-08-07
- Fix: Issue where compressed texture did loose LOD information ([issue](https://linear.app/needle/issue/NE-6669))
- Chore: Warn once if multi-mesh primitive is detected but compressed asset doesnt have densities per primitive, meaning an older compression pipeline version was used in processing this asset that would require an update for correct LOD updates

## [3.1.0] - 2025-08-06
- Add: Queue to limit max concurrent LOD requests
- Fix: Spread the skinned mesh bounds calculation over the available frames (defined by `skinnedMeshAutoUpdateBoundsInterval`)

## [3.0.0] - 2025-08-04
- Add: `awaitLoading` function to LODsManager which returns a promise that resolves once all LODs that started loading during this frame have finished. This can be used to hide lowres LODs at the initial start of the website (e.g. via CSS blur)
- Change: Use mesh densities per primitive 

## [2.1.4] - 2025-04-13
- Fix: Don't minify internal exports (e.g. class names of three.js)

## [2.1.3] - 2025-03-19
- Fix: DracoLoader cache busting due to range request

## [2.1.2] - 2025-03-10

## [2.1.0-alpha.3] - 2025-01-21
- Change: Load Draco and KTX loaders as soon as possible
